      h1 The Hackference
      p Hackference is a three day technology driven event in the heart of Birmingham. The first day conference will include several talks from leading tech specialists. This will then be followed up by a two day hackathon. We aim to provide developers with new and exciting tools to add to their hacking arsenal.</p>
      p This year weâ€™re doing things a little differently. Not only will we be showcasing some of the greatest names in the development world, we will also be heading into the front end of the web. Frontend or backend, there is something here for you. Check out our awesome speakers.
